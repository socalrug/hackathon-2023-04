# SoCal RUG Hackathon 2023-04

## Event Summary

The SoCal RUG Hackathon 2023-04, hosted by the [Southern California R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/SOCAL-RUG/) and the [UCI Paul Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu). It is a two-day event where you will "hack" a data set for fun, education, and prizes.  The focus of the event is on education and teamwork, with the main goal of taking a data set from its "raw" form all the way through to a final "product" (e.g. visualization, model, insight).  To frame this process, the event will have a competitive aspect where teams will present their work at end of the event to a panel of judges, with prizes awarded in several categories (see below).

The event will start with a series of practical educational tutorials to get you started with the fundamentals of data analysis using the R programming language. This will be followed by working sessions where teams will explore and analyze the data set in preparation for the presentations. Participants will work in small teams (2 - 5 people).  Teams can either be pre-arranged by participants themselves or will be assigned at the start of the event.  

This event is open to data scientists, enthusiasts and hackers of all levels, from the beginner to the highly experienced.  If you are a beginner, it may be helpful to do some preparatory learning before the event — see the suggested resources below.  If you are an experienced user, we look forward to you sharing your expertise with others. Assisting others, both within and between teams, is highly encouraged.

During this event you can use any tool that you want. You are not limited to R. It is common for data teams to use a mixture of tools such as programming languages, interactive data visualization software, data analytics, reporting, and integration tools. Putting the data into a database and using SQL based tooling has been an effective approach. 

## Goals of the Hackathon

* The hackathon is primarily an *educational* event, not a competition.  However, the hackathon is framed in the context of a competition to provide overall structure. It includes team-based collaboration to create a presentation that will be judged by a panel and prizes will be awarded.
* *Novice Users*: provides an opportunity to work with real-world data sets from start (acquire the data) to finish (produce a final “report” on the findings from their work).
* *Experienced Users*: provide an opportunity to practice data analysis skills in a structured environment, interact with others, and assist people that are new to analyzing data.

## Saturday Evening Challenge Event

On Saturday evening, we will have an hour-long data challenge event, the idea is to take a break from the main hackathon work, meet people and have some fun. This will be an opportunity to interact with other participants outside of your team, practice your data hacking skills on a new data set, and win prizes.
